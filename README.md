Description
This is a full periodic table of elements. The initial version of this was a simple HTML and CSS created as a required task on a Web Development course I was enrolled in. The initial purpose was just to focus on layout, CSS, and extensive use of div tags (hence why the periodic table was coded manually).

I have added additional elements in the form of a modal pop-up that contains information obtained from an API call. The page is visually appealing and functional. However, at present, it is best viewed on larger screens and may not function properly on Internet Explorer. I will work on making it responsive in the future.
